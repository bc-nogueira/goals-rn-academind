# Goals RN Project

This is a basic project made with React Native for studying purposes. It's an app to build a goals list. You can add, view and delete your goals. The data is not persisted so it will reloaded whenever the app is refreshed or restarted.

I coded along during the course [React Native - The Practical Guide [2023]
](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/?kw=React+Native+-+The+Practical+Guide+%5B2023%5D&src=sac) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller at Udemy.

## My changes

Everything included in the first commit is from the original project. All later commits are changes that I made to the project. These changes include:

- Disable `Add Goal Button` if input is empty. :heavy_check_mark:
- Existing goal validation (doesn't allow to add repeated goal). :heavy_check_mark:
